I've created a comprehensive Vim plugin that integrates VimOutliner-style percentage completion into Vimwiki checkboxes. Here's what the plugin provides:
Key Features:

Checkbox State Mapping: Maps checkbox characters to percentages:

[ ] = 0% (empty/unchecked)
[.] = 25% (quarter done)
[-] = 50% (half done)
[+] = 75% (three-quarters done)
[X] = 100% (complete)


Automatic Percentage Display: Shows percentages next to checkboxes (e.g., [.] Task name 25%)
Parent-Child Calculation: Automatically calculates parent checkbox percentages based on children completion
Custom Percentage Setting: Set any percentage value and it automatically chooses the closest checkbox state

Usage:

<C-Space>: Toggle checkbox and update percentages
:VimwikiSetPercentage 60: Set specific percentage (will become [+] 75% as closest state)
<leader>wp: Quick prefix for setting percentages
<leader>wu: Update all percentages on current line and parents
:VimwikiUpdatePercentages: Manual update command

Installation:

Save as ~/.vim/plugin/vimwiki_percentage.vim (or in your plugin manager)
Make sure you have Vimwiki installed
The plugin will automatically activate for .wiki files

Configuration:
" Disable percentage system
let g:vimwiki_percentage_enabled = 0

" Disable automatic parent updates
let g:vimwiki_percentage_auto_update = 0
